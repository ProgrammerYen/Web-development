            <p>
                Hi there everyone, my name is Yenula De Alwis and I welcome you to my personal site. Currently, I am 12 years 
                old and I guess we could say I <strong>LOVE</strong> programming. I also <strong>LOVE</strong> maths and pretty 
                much any logical subject. This site is not very beautiful (to be truly honest) due to there being no CSS. 
                This is because I am not proficient in web dev <strong><em><u>YET</u></em></strong>. However, I am almost quite 
                proficient in Python, but I need to learn more about data structures and algorithms to properly become 
                a Python guru.
            </p>

        <h3><em>My aim</em></h3>
        <p>
            Currently, I am learning Python and obviously HTML (as I am coding this). I am proficient in the language python and I can confidently say this. However, I have decided to dive deeper into web develoment. This is because web dev is important for softaware
            engineering (front-end engineering). Despite this, I wish to master backend development too to become a programming guru. Python is part of this, however I am planning to also learn Java and/or C++ and SQL. This will allow me to become closer
            to a programming guru.
        </p>
